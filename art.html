	<dd><b>1. Sonepur Fair</b>
		<dt>Legend apart, the famous Sonepur fair in more of a cattle trading centre where incredible number of birds and cattle are brought from different parts of the country. Besides, the bewildering array of wares are on sale and add to this the numerous folk shows about which the BBC once remarked, "there’s nothing like the Sonepur Cabaret." The time to start is very early in the morning when the fog is suddenly pierced by the sun and the huge gathering has just emerged from the holy dip in the cold absolving waters. The mela that lasts upto a fortnight, provides enough time to talk to the parrots, watch the elephants being bathed leisurely, followed by ear splitting trumpets and then the artists working up with colourful designs to decorate the elephants as if the pachyderm has been tatooed all over, see the horses being tested for their speed and stamina, big bulky buffaloes being milked and likewise all other animals demonstrating their skill, strength and productivity.

	<dd><b>2.Nag Panchmi</b>
		<dt>The rainy month of Sravana when there is danger of death from snake bite, people appease the snake god by offering milk during Nag Panchmi.

In fact naga worship is wide spread through out India.

	<dd><b>3. Gaya - Pitrapaksha Mela</b>
		<dt>Arond september the sleepy town of Gaya is agog with people who come here for the famous Pitrapaksha mela or the ancestor worship typified in Sraddha ritual. It is time for the Gayalis (the descendants of Magga Brahmans who were once devotees of Shiva but later converted to Vaishnavism) to be prepared for the vedic Sraddha ceremonies or the pindan - a mandatory Hind rite that is supposed to bring salvation to the departed soul. In the early Dharmasastras, Vishnu provides a list of over 50 tirthas but it proclaims that dead ancestors pray to God for a son who would offer pinda (lymph of rice) to them at Gaya.

	<dd><b>4. Chaath-Fasting</b>
		<dt>Chaath in Bihar can best be seen at Deo in Aurangabad or Baragaon near Nalanda, noted for their sun temples. Unlike other sun temples in India that faces East, the temple at Deo faces west and during the festival time it is the most crowded place. It is strange to see a Brahmin standing in the river water next to a Harijan ! The festival is more of a sacrifice which entails purificatory preparation. It can be performed by men or women, irrespective to caste or creed. Chaath commences with the end of Deepavali when the house is thoroughly cleaned, family members go in for a holy dip, strict saltless vegetarian menu is observed (even onions and garlic are considered unwanted during the entire festival period), all earthen vessels are reserved for the period only and all possible purity of food is adhered to; clothes have to be unstitched and people sleep on the floor.

	<dd><b>2. Ashokastami Festival</b>

		<dt>Unakoti is ornamented with huge rock-cut images of gods and goddesses in the midst of liberal gift of nature. Call it a holy place a historical remains or a hill station, every denomination seems befitting. However, ‘Sitakunda’ or ‘Ashtamikunda’, a natural reservoir emanating from a romping spring of crystal water becomes the most tantalizing attraction to the people on Maghi Sankranti (in February) and Ashokastami when they, beating the shivering cold take dip into it. With the passing time Raghunandan Parvat of the past has given way to Unakoti, just 10 k.m. away from Kailashahar. Here nature has opened its heart out and the sculptors have staked their dexterity in full. Mesmerised by its vastness and uniqueness Archaeological Survey of India compared the archaeological remains of Unakoti with the famous sculptures of Mahabalipuram. It is also regarded the largest bas-relief, the sculptures carved on the face of a hill in India.

Only head-images are identified by various Brahmanical names like “Hara”, “Uma”, “Hari”, “Maa”, “Bani”, “Kumar”, “Ganesh”, “Brahma”, “Pritthi”, “Ganga”, “Abdi”, “Kamesh” and “Himadri”. These head-images have been accepted as popular deities by the Hindus of Tripura also. There are many legends about these fourteen deities floating in the state. The ceremonial worship starts a day before the festival. Buffalo, richha, he-goats, eggs, bamboo poles and pipes, umbrella, earthen pot, duck, pigeon, bamboo stick, thread, cotton, turmeric, vermilion, wine, banana leaves and rice are some of the important ingredients for the worship. “Chantai” or the chief priest chants mantras and his assistant sacrifices the animals. A grand colourful fair held on this occasion continues for seven days. The uniqueness of the festival lies in the fact that this becomes a symbol of peace, harmony and fraternity as people irrespective of cast, creed and religious flock to the place to the celebrate the festival.
